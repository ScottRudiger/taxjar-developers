Building a custom integration with TaxJar? In these guides, we’ll cover everything you need to know about handling sales tax calculations, reporting, and filing for your own platform. Before you build a new integration from scratch, we recommend reading these guides and browsing our [API documentation](/api/reference/) so you fully understand what can be accomplished through [SmartCalcs](https://www.taxjar.com/smartcalcs/), our sales tax API.

If you have any questions or feedback, please reach out to [support@taxjar.com](mailto:support@taxjar.com).

Thanks for choosing TaxJar!
