## How do I get a sandbox account?

At this time, we don't have a sandbox environment for developing purposes, but know it is important and plan to have one soon. Please [contact our support team](https://www.taxjar.com/contact/) to add your name to a list of customers to be notified when this feature is available.

In the meantime, we recommend that you create a free trial account and use this account to work against production. We're also happy to provide trial extensions if necessary to work on development of a new site. We suggest mocks / stubs for your tests until we provide a sandbox.

## How do I reset my API token?

At this time you will need to contact [TaxJar support](https://www.taxjar.com/contact/) to reset your API token. Upon reset, your old token will immediately stop working and you can log in to generate a new token. We plan to offer automatic resets in the near future.
